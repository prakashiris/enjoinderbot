# Testing the Bot
          Testing the bot is a part of our interactive learning process. We keep checking all the possible scenarios initially thought for the bot and train it accordingly. I tested Horoscope Bot for some other scenarios and trained it accordingly. The following is one of them that is a bit different than what we did earlier in this chapter. 
# Test Case 1
Let’s run the first test: 
  User: Hello there! 
  HoroscopeBot: Hello! What can I do for you? 
  User: What’s the horoscope for Capricorn today? 
  HoroscopeBot: Your today’s horoscope: The journey from defeat to success is driven by optimism. You will be very optimistic today—about your work, future, and everything that can lead you to success, says Ganesha. You will also be very careful while dealing with day-to-day work, and will capitalize on every opportunity that can get you a step closer to your goals. Determination and good luck is all you need to realize your dreams; you will have both today.
